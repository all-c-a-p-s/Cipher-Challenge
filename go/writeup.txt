1. Identifying the Cipher:
- 25 unique letters with no J -> grid cipher, IOC ~ 1.2 -> polyalphabetic
  - playfair cipher
  - bifid cipher (1902 title is also a hint towards this)
  - two-square cipher (if both grids exclude the same letter)
  - four-square cipher

other alternatives:
  - trifid cipher (based on 1902 hint and IOC) - does not explain 15 unique characters in ciphertext (not counting space)
  - grid cipher + some other substitution/transposition
  - many options in the unlikely case that the character ' ' (space) is used as a character in the alphabet e.g. trifid as above

Focus on why we looked at the ciphers we did (maybe also mistakes we made) and how we narrowed down the options

2. How we Chose Our Approach:
- hard to write about for now because we used a dictionary attack lmao
- "we chose simulated annealing because it's really well suited to optimisations problems where you must avoid local minima"
